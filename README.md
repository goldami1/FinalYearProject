<p align="center" style="font-size:100%;"><i>Graduation Project - B.Sc in Computer Science</i></p>
<h2>Brief Intro</h2>

* Xamarin based Cross-Platform client application.
* AgentVI App intends to provide Innovi clients with additional GUI platform.
* Prior implementation of this project, Innovi AgentVI clients had a desktop web UI.
* Innovi AgentVI's web UI provides its clients with highly informative data and tools - which in most of the time isn't what the user is looking for.
* Following the completion of this project - Innovi AgentVI can provide their customers with a mobile UI which is supported both by iOS and Android.
* AgentVI App Features:
  * Live stream from sensors.
  * Visibility of sensors.
  * Filtration based on interest-by-sites.
  * Tagging events.
  * Sensors health history visibility.
  * Notifications based on real time events.
